# AI-Powered Tax Document Parser

## Overview

The AI-Powered Tax Document Parser is a system designed to process various financial documents—such as tax returns, bank statements, and invoices—to extract and analyze critical information. Leveraging artificial intelligence, it performs compliance checks and offers recommendations, integrating with a conversational agent to explain findings to users.

## Features

- **Document Parsing**: Utilizes tools like `pdfplumber` or `PyMuPDF` to extract text from PDF documents.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Employs `spaCy` or OpenAI's language models to identify key entities such as income, deductions, and dates.
- **Compliance Advisory**: Compares extracted data against current tax regulations to provide recommendations and identify discrepancies.
- **Backend API**: Developed using Node.js with Express.js to handle document processing and AI model interactions.
- **Frontend Interface**: A web-based platform that allows users to upload documents and view parsed results in an intuitive interface.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the application, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

To deploy the frontend application:

1. **Build the production version**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to a hosting service**:
   - **Vercel**:
     - Install Vercel CLI:
       ```bash
       npm install -g vercel
       ```
     - Deploy:
       ```bash
       vercel
       ```
   - **Netlify**:
     - Install Netlify CLI:
       ```bash
       npm install -g netlify-cli
       ```
     - Deploy:
       ```bash
       netlify deploy
       ```

### Backend Deployment

To deploy the backend API:

1. **Choose a hosting platform** (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed on the server.
   - Transfer the backend files to the server.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Set environment variables, including `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application relies on the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing AI services.

Ensure these variables are set appropriately in the `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
